Got it 👍
You’d like a **wireframe design** for a booking flow where a **single client can have multiple appointments**. Let’s outline the wireframe concept step by step.

---

## 🎨 Wireframe Structure for Multiple Appointments (Single Client)

### **1. Client Information (Top Section)**

* **Dropdown:** Select Client *(required)*
* **Client Profile Preview:** Once selected, show key details (phone/email, last visits).

---

### **2. Appointment List Section (Core Feature)**

This is the big change from your current design.

* **Table/Grid with Rows for Each Appointment**

  * **Service Selection Dropdown** (or multi-select with search/filter)
  * **Duration & Price** (auto-populates from service database)
  * **Assigned Staff** dropdown
  * **Date Picker**
  * **Start Time Picker**
  * **Auto-calculated End Time**

* **Add Another Appointment Button (+)**

  * Inserts a new row into the table for an additional appointment.
  * Keeps the same client but allows different services, staff, times.

---

### **3. Summary Section**

* **Total Duration:** Sum of all selected appointments
* **Total Price:** Sum of all selected services
* **Timeline Preview (optional):** Small horizontal timeline showing how appointments line up

  * Helps visualize overlaps / conflicts.

---

### **4. Notes Section**

* Textbox for general notes (applies to all appointments).
* Optional: inline notes per appointment row.

---

### **5. Actions**

* **Cancel** (grey button)
* **Save & Book All Appointments** (primary button)

| [ + Add Another Appointment ]               |
------------------------------------------------
| Total Duration: XX mins  |  Total: $XXXX    |
| [Timeline Preview bar optional]             |
------------------------------------------------
| Notes: [__________________________________] |
------------------------------------------------
|  [Cancel]                          [Book]   |
------------------------------------------------
```

👉 This design keeps your current flow but adds **multiple appointment rows** under one client, which is the key to supporting multiple bookings at once.

Would you like me to **turn this into a visual low-fidelity wireframe mockup (boxes & layout sketch)** so you can show it to your dev/designer team?
