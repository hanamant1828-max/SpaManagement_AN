Add Staff Tracking for Product Sales in Integrated Billing

CONTEXT:
Currently, services track which staff performed them. Products/inventory items do NOT track which staff member promoted/sold them. Need to add this feature.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. FRONTEND (integrated_billing.html):
   In the "Products & Inventory" section, add a Staff Member dropdown:
   
   Current layout:
   Product | Batch | Quantity | Unit Price | [+]
   
   New layout:
   Product | Staff Member | Batch | Quantity | Unit Price | [+]
   
   - Add staff dropdown between Product and Batch columns
   - Populate with all active staff from staff_members variable
   - Make it REQUIRED when product is selected
   - Use same styling as service staff dropdown
   - Add to form name: product_staff_ids[]

2. BACKEND (modules/billing/integrated_billing_views.py):
   
   In create_professional_invoice() function:
   
   a) Parse product staff data:
      product_staff_ids = request.form.getlist('product_staff_ids[]')
   
   b) When creating InvoiceItem for inventory (around line 520):
      item.staff_id = int(product_staff_ids[i]) if i < len(product_staff_ids) else None
   
   c) Update staff metrics for product sales (after inventory items loop):
      - Loop through inventory_data with staff_ids
      - Update staff.total_revenue_generated
      - Update staff.total_sales  
      - Update staff.total_clients_served
      - Same logic as service staff updates (around line 535)

3. VALIDATION:
   - Staff must be selected when product is added
   - Show error: "Please assign staff for all products"
   - Validate before form submission

4. DISPLAY:
   On invoice detail page (integrated_invoice_detail.html):
   - Show staff name for each product line item
   - Use same format as service items

FILES TO MODIFY:
1. templates/integrated_billing.html (add staff column to products section)
2. modules/billing/integrated_billing_views.py (parse staff_ids, update metrics)
3. templates/integrated_invoice_detail.html (display staff on invoice)

IMPORTANT:
- Follow exact same pattern as service staff tracking
- Don't break existing product/batch functionality
- Maintain FIFO batch selection
- Test with multiple products + different staff
