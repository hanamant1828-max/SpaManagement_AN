Looking at your application configuration, the database name is spa_management.db.

This is configured in your app.py file where you can see:

# Configure the database - SQLite
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///spa_management.db'
Since you're using SQLite, the database is stored as a file named spa_management.db in your project's root directory. SQLite databases are single files that contain all the tables, indexes, and data for your spa management system.

BUT WHEN I PUSH THIS DATABASE AND OPEN IN ANOTHER REPLIT ACCOUNT IT IS NOT SHOWING THE DATA

OK

The issue you're experiencing is that your SQLite database (spa_management.db) is not being transferred when you share your Replit project or access it from another account. This is because SQLite databases are file-based and stored locally in your Repl's file system.

Here are the solutions to make your data persistent and shareable:

Solution 1: Use Replit's Key-Value Store (Recommended for sharing data)
I'll modify your app to use Replit's built-in database that persists across accounts and shares.

database_migration.py
python database_migration.py
Solution 2: Include the SQLite database in your project files
.gitignore
Solution 3: Create a data seeding script that runs automatically
main.py
How to use these solutions:
Export current data to Replit DB: Run the migration script to save your current SQLite data to Replit's Key-Value Store:

python database_migration.py
Import data in new Repl: When you open the project in another account, the app will automatically try to restore data from Replit DB.

Manual import: If needed, you can manually import data:

python database_migration.py import
The Replit Key-Value Store persists across accounts and shares, so your data will be available when someone else accesses your Repl. This is the best solution for sharing demo data across different Replit accounts.

Assistant automatically restarted your App after applying file changes. You can disable this behavior in 
.
Apply all:
Edit file
database_migration.py
Run shell command:
python database_migration.py
Edit file
.gitignore
Edit file
main.py
