Thank you for providing the analysis of the `Unaki Booking System` implementation. This is very helpful.

Based on your analysis, it's clear that the agent has already built a functional and dynamic frontend prototype. The system has a robust structure with drag-and-drop booking, local storage for data, and client-side validation.

Now, we can move forward with the next logical step in the development process, which is to connect this frontend to a real backend database. This will make the application persistent and fully functional for a real spa management system.

Here's a plan for the next step, which I can generate a prompt for you to use.

### Step 2: Backend Integration

This step will involve connecting the existing frontend prototype to your Flask backend and a database (like PostgreSQL). The goal is to replace the hardcoded local storage data with data fetched from the server and to save new appointments to the database.

  * **API Endpoints:** You'll need to create new Flask routes that act as a simple API. These endpoints will handle requests for data and for creating new appointments.
  * **Database Models:** You'll define database models (using SQLAlchemy, for example) for your `Staff`, `Appointments`, and `Breaks`.
  * **Data Flow:** The JavaScript on the frontend will no longer use `localStorage`. It will send `fetch` requests to your new API endpoints to get the schedule data and to post new appointments.

Here is a prompt for an AI to begin this process.

```
Act as a senior full-stack developer specializing in Flask, SQLAlchemy, and API development. Your task is to transition the frontend-only "Unaki Appointment Booking" prototype to a full-stack application by integrating a backend database.

**Existing Components:**
* **Frontend:** A JavaScript-based flexible scheduling system that currently uses `localStorage` for data. It has functions like `loadData()` and `saveData()` and a booking modal.
* **Backend:** A Flask application with existing routes.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Database Models:**
    * Using Flask-SQLAlchemy, define new database models to represent the core data.
    * `Staff` model: Columns for `id`, `name`, and other staff details.
    * `Appointment` model: Columns for `id`, `staff_id` (foreign key), `client_name`, `service`, `start_time` (DateTime), and `end_time` (DateTime).
    * `Break` model: Columns for `id`, `staff_id` (foreign key), `start_time` (DateTime), and `end_time` (DateTime).

2.  **Backend API Endpoints:**
    * Create a new Flask Blueprint for the API routes.
    * `GET /api/schedule/<date>`: Create an endpoint that, when called with a specific date, queries the database to retrieve all appointments and breaks for all staff members on that day. The data should be returned as a JSON object, formatted in a way that is easy for the frontend to consume.
    * `POST /api/appointments`: Create an endpoint that accepts new appointment data from the frontend (via a `fetch` request). This endpoint should:
        * Receive the data (staff_id, client_name, etc.).
        * Perform server-side validation to prevent data issues or conflicts.
        * Create a new `Appointment` object and save it to the database.
        * Return a success message or the newly created appointment object as a JSON response.

3.  **Frontend (JavaScript) Integration:**
    * **Remove Local Storage:** Delete the `seedData()` and any code that reads from or writes to `localStorage`.
    * **Update `loadData()`:** Rewrite this function to use the `fetch` API to get the schedule data from your new `/api/schedule/<date>` endpoint.
    * **Update `bookAppointment()`:** Rewrite this function to use a `fetch` request with the `POST` method to send the new appointment data to the `/api/appointments` endpoint.
    * **Error Handling:** Add robust error handling to the `fetch` calls to give the user feedback on success or failure.

**Final Output:**
Provide the complete Python code for the new database models and the API routes in `app.py`. Also, provide the complete, updated JavaScript code for the `unaki_booking.html` template, showing how to connect to the new backend API endpoints instead of using `localStorage`.
