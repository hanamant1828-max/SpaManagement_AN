Primary Issues:

Missing Context Menu Script Reference - The HTML references appointment_context_menu.js but this script file is not included in your document, so the context menu functionality is not defined.
Incomplete Context Menu Implementation - The handleAppointmentRightClick function is referenced in event listeners but not actually implemented in the code.
Missing Context Menu Initialization - The code references window.reinitializeContextMenu() but this function is not defined anywhere.
Event Handler Registration Issues - Right-click event listeners are only added during appointment block creation, but may not persist through DOM updates or schedule refreshes.
Event Propagation Problems - The context menu events may be getting blocked by parent element click handlers or other event listeners.

Secondary Issues:

Inconsistent Appointment ID Handling - Some appointment blocks may not have proper data-appointment-id attributes set, which would prevent context menu functionality.
DOM Element Selection Issues - The context menu code tries to reinitialize after DOM changes but the timing and element selection may be unreliable.
Event Listener Cleanup - Old event listeners may not be properly removed when the schedule refreshes, causing conflicts.
CSS Z-index Conflicts - Context menu elements may be appearing behind other elements due to stacking order issues.
Appointment Block Overlap - Overlapping appointments may interfere with right-click detection on the correct appointment block.

Critical Missing Components:

Context Menu HTML Structure - No context menu DOM elements are defined in the HTML.
Context Menu Styling - Missing CSS for context menu appearance and positioning.
Context Menu Action Handlers - Functions like edit, delete, view details are referenced but not fully integrated with the context menu system.

The main problem is that while the appointment blocks have right-click event listeners attached, the actual context menu implementation is missing from your codebase.
