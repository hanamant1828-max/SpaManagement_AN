Petty Cash Management System
Simple Requirements for Spa
1. What I Need
I need a simple app to track petty cash in my spa. Staff should be able to record expenses on mobile/computer, I should be able to approve them, and see reports.
2. Users & Access
User Type	What They Can Do
Owner (Me)	See everything, approve/reject expenses, view reports, manage settings
Manager	Approve expenses, view reports, do daily reconciliation
Staff	Add expenses, view their own expenses only

3. Main Features
A. Cash Float Setup
•	Set opening cash amount (e.g., ₹10,000)
•	Add money when needed (replenishment)
B. Recording Expenses
When staff spends money, they enter:
•	Amount
•	Category (Office Supplies, Spa Products, Cleaning, etc.)
•	What they bought (description)
•	Where they bought it (vendor name)
•	Receipt photo (OPTIONAL - can skip)
C. Approval System
•	Small expenses (below ₹500) - Auto approved
•	Medium expenses (₹500 to ₹2,000) - Manager approves
•	Large expenses (above ₹2,000) - Owner approves
D. Daily Reconciliation
•	At end of day, count actual cash in box
•	Enter the counted amount in system
•	System shows if there's shortage or excess
E. Reports
•	Daily report - Total spent today
•	Weekly report - Spending trends
•	Monthly report - Complete details for accounting

4. Expense Categories
•	Office Supplies

•	Refreshments
•	Maintenance
•	Transportation
•	Utilities

Note: I should be able to add or remove categories later.

5. Dashboard (Home Screen)
When I login, I should see:
•	Current cash balance (big number on top)
•	Today's total expenses
•	Number of pending approvals
•	Chart showing last 7 days spending
•	Recent transactions list
6. Technical Requirements
Platform
•	Web-based (works on any browser)
•	Mobile-friendly (responsive design)
Security
•	Login with username & password
•	Different access levels for owner/manager/staff
•	All actions tracked (who did what & when)
Notifications
•	Email when expense needs approval
•	Email when expense approved/rejected
•	Alert when cash is running low
7. Simple Workflow Example
Staff buys supplies for ₹350:
1.	Staff opens app on phone
2.	Clicks 'Add Expense'
3.	Enters: ₹350, Cleaning Supplies, bought mops and cleaner
4.	Skips receipt (optional)
5.	Clicks Submit
6.	System auto-approves (below ₹500)
7.	Cash balance updates automatically
8. Important Points
•	Receipt upload is OPTIONAL - staff can submit without receipt
•	Keep interface simple and clean
•	Big buttons for mobile use
•	Fast loading (under 3 seconds)
•	Daily automatic backup of all data
9. Timeline
•	Week 1-2: Design screens & database
•	Week 3-8: Build the system
•	Week 9-10: Testing
•	Week 11: Training & Go live
