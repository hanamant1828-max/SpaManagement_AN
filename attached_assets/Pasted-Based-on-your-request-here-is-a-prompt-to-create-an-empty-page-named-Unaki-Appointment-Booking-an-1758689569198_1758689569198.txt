### Prompt to Create a New Page and Menu Item

```
Act as a senior full-stack developer specializing in Flask and Jinja2. Your task is to create a new, empty page and a new menu item for a spa management application.

**Page Details:**
* **Page Name:** "Unaki Appointment Booking"
* **URL Endpoint:** `/unaki-booking`
* **Content:** The page should be completely empty except for the standard page layout. It should serve as a placeholder for future development.

**Menu Item Details:**
* **Menu Item Name:** "Unaki Appointment Booking"
* **Location:** The menu item should be added to the main navigation bar.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Backend (`app.py`):**
    * Create a new Flask route at the `/unaki-booking` endpoint.
    * The route function should be named `unaki_booking`.
    * This function should simply render a new Jinja2 template named `unaki_booking.html`.

2.  **Frontend Template (`unaki_booking.html`):**
    * Create a new HTML file with this name.
    * Ensure the file extends your existing base template (`base.html`) to inherit the navigation bar and overall layout.
    * Use the `{% block title %}` and `{% block content %}` Jinja2 syntax.
    * Set the title block to "Unaki Appointment Booking".
    * Leave the `content` block empty.

3.  **Menu Item Modification (`base.html`):**
    * Locate the main navigation section of your `base.html` file, where menu items are defined (usually with `<ul>` and `<li>` tags).
    * Add a new `<li>` element.
    * Inside the new `<li>`, add an `<a>` tag.
    * Set the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag to the URL for the new page using Flask's `url_for` function: `{{ url_for('unaki_booking') }}`.
    * Set the visible text of the `<a>` tag to "Unaki Appointment Booking".

**Final Output:**
Provide the complete code for the new Flask route in `app.py`, the complete code for the new `unaki_booking.html` template, and the modified section of the `base.html` file showing the newly added menu item.
