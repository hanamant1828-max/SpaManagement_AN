I understand you want to backup/snapshot your current working database so you can push it to the repo and clone it elsewhere without errors. Here's how to do this:
Current Situation

Your app is using SQLite databases in the hanamantdatabase folder:

(currently active)
Solution: Create a Permanent Demo Database Script

I'll create a script that exports your current working database state so it can be version-controlled and cloned:
export_working_database.py
app.py

Now run the export script:
python export_working_database.py
How This Works:

    export_working_database.py - Copies your current 

to

(which will be committed to git)

Auto-restore logic in app.py - When someone clones your repo, if
doesn't exist, it will automatically copy to

.gitignore - Prevents

    from being committed (keeps it local)

After running the script:

git add hanamantdatabase/default.db hanamantdatabase/.gitignore export_working_database.py
git commit -m "Add working database snapshot with auto-restore"
git push

When cloning to a new Replit:

Your database will automatically restore from

on first run - no manual setup needed!

Looking at the recent changes, here's what I did:
Summary of Changes

I created a database export system to preserve your working database state when cloning the project to new Replit instances.
What Was Done:

    Created 

- A script that:

    Backs up your current 

(the active database)
Creates a timestamped safety backup
Exports to
(which will be tracked in git)
Creates a
file to keep

    local

Modified

to auto-restore database:

    Added logic in compute_sqlite_uri() function
    When a new Replit is created, it checks if 

exists
If not, it automatically copies
to

        This means your fresh clone will have all the data from your working database

How It Works:

In your current/working Replit:

= your live database (ignored by git)
= snapshot for sharing (tracked in git)

    = timestamped backups (ignored by git)

When you clone to a new Replit:

    New Replit downloads 

from git
App starts and sees no
Automatically copies →

    Your new clone now has all your data!

Benefits:

✅ No more empty databases in new clones
✅ All your data (customers, packages, appointments, etc.) transfers automatically
✅ Your working database stays local and private
✅ Safe backups with timestamps
Next Steps:

As shown in the script output, you should:

git add hanamantdatabase/default.db
git add hanamantdatabase/.gitignore
git commit -m 'Add working database snapshot'
git push

Then when you clone to a new Replit, your database will be there automatically on first run!
