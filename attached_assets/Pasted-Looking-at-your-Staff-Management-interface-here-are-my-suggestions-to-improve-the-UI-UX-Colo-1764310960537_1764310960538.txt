Looking at your Staff Management interface, here are my suggestions to improve the UI/UX:

## Color Theme Recommendations

**Current Issues:**
- Too many competing bright colors (blue, green, cyan, yellow) create visual chaos
- Yellow action buttons are hard to read and can cause eye strain
- The color scheme lacks hierarchy and cohesion

**Suggested Color Palette:**
- **Primary:** Deep blue (#2563EB) or professional teal (#0891B2)
- **Secondary:** Neutral grays (#F3F4F6, #E5E7EB, #6B7280)
- **Accent:** Emerald green (#10B981) for success/active states
- **Warning/Action:** Amber (#F59E0B) - use sparingly
- **Background:** Light gray (#F9FAFB) or white
- **Text:** Dark gray (#1F2937) for primary, medium gray (#6B7280) for secondary

## Specific UI/UX Improvements

**Stats Cards (Top Section):**
- Use subtle backgrounds with colored left borders instead of fully colored cards
- Consider a single neutral background with colored icons only
- Add subtle shadows for depth rather than bright colors

**Action Buttons:**
- Change yellow buttons to white/light gray with colored icons
- Use outline buttons for secondary actions
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment

**Staff Table:**
- Replace yellow action buttons with icon-only buttons in neutral gray
- Add hover states that show color (blue for edit, red for delete)
- Increase white space between rows for better readability
- Add subtle row hover effect (light gray background)

**Search & Filter Section:**
- Reduce the prominence of the "Clear" button (make it outline style)
- Add subtle borders to dropdowns instead of heavy boxes
- Align elements with consistent padding

**Typography:**
- Ensure consistent font weights (current seems inconsistent)
- Use larger font size for staff names
- Increase line height for better readability

**Overall:**
- Adopt a more minimal, modern approach with one primary color
- Use color strategically to draw attention, not everywhere
- Add micro-interactions (smooth transitions on hover, button presses)
- Consider card-style layout for individual staff members instead of a table for mobile responsiveness

The key is: **less color, more white space, better hierarchy**.
