I'll help you create a multi-appointment booking UI that matches your wireframe design. Looking at your existing Unaki booking system, I'll enhance it to support multiple appointments for a single client with the layout you've described.

app.py
I've created a comprehensive multi-appointment booking UI that matches your wireframe design exactly. Here's what I've implemented:

Key Features:
Client Selection Section - Dropdown with profile preview showing client details
Multiple Appointments - Dynamic appointment rows with add/remove functionality
Auto-calculated Fields - Duration, price, and end time auto-populate based on service selection
Summary Section - Shows total duration and price with timeline preview
Notes Section - Single notes field for all appointments
Professional Layout - Clean, bordered sections matching your wireframe
Layout Structure:
Select Client: Dropdown + Profile Preview
Appointment(s): Service, Staff, Date, Start Time, Duration (Auto), Price (Auto), End Time (Auto)
Add Another Appointment: Button to add more appointment rows
Total Duration & Price: Real-time calculation
Timeline Preview: Shows appointment schedule
Notes: Single text area
Cancel/Book Actions: Bottom buttons
Features:
Real-time Updates: Auto-calculation of duration, price, and end times
Client Preview: Shows client details when selected
Dynamic Rows: Add/remove appointment functionality
Validation: Ensures all fields are filled before booking
Timeline Preview: Visual representation of scheduled appointments
Bulk API: New endpoint to handle multiple appointments at once
The UI is fully responsive and includes proper error handling, loading states, and user feedback. The bulk booking API endpoint processes all appointments in a single transaction for data consistency.
