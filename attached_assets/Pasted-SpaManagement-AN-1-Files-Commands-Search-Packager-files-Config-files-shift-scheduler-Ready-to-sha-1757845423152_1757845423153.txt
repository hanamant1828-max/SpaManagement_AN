Shift Management System Overview The Shift Management system is a comprehensive scheduling solution that allows you to create, manage, and track staff work schedules with date ranges and flexible working patterns. System Architecture Files Involved: Frontend: templates/shift_scheduler.html, static/js/shift_scheduler.js, static/css/shift_scheduler.css Backend: modules/staff/shift_scheduler_views.py Database Model: StaffScheduleRange in models.py How It Works 1. ADD Operations Two Ways to Add Schedules: Quick Date Range Generation: Select staff member from dropdown Choose start and end dates Click "Generate Days" to create a table Use bulk actions to set working patterns Save the schedule Modal-Based Creation: Click "Add Assign Shift" button Select staff member and date range Click "Generate Shift Table" Configure working days, times, and breaks Save schedule Backend Process (save_shift_schedule): # Creates StaffScheduleRange records # Supports both single-day and multi-day ranges # Handles working day patterns (Mon-Sun) # Stores shift times, break times, and descriptions 2. VIEW Operations Multiple View Options: Management Table View: Shows all schedules grouped by staff Displays date ranges and working days summary Shows office days patterns (Mon-Fri, Weekends, etc.) Staff Details Modal: Complete staff information All schedules for that staff member Individual schedule details with actions Schedule Details View: Read-only detailed view of a specific schedule Shows all working days, times, breaks Schedule status and priority information Key Features: Color-coded day representation Working days badges (Mon-Fri, Weekends, All Days) Responsive design for mobile/tablet Search and filter capabilities 3. EDIT Operations Unified Edit Modal System: Single Schedule Edit: Click edit button on any schedule Pre-populated form with existing data Supports date range changes Real-time validation Multiple Schedule Selection: When staff has multiple schedules Shows selection modal to choose which to edit Option to edit all in configuration mode Backend Process (api_update_schedule_with_range): # Supports date range modifications # Creates new schedule if dates change (preserves history) # Updates working patterns and times # Maintains data integrity Advanced Features: Date range validation Conflict detection Automatic schedule versioning Bulk update capabilities 4. DELETE Operations Multiple Delete Options: Single Schedule Delete: Delete button on individual schedules Confirmation prompt Soft delete (marks as inactive) Bulk Delete: Select multiple schedules with checkboxes "Delete Selected" action Batch processing Staff Schedule Cleanup: Delete all schedules for a staff member Accessed from management table Complete cleanup option Backend Process (delete_shift_schedules): # Soft delete approach (is_active = False) # Supports both single and bulk operations # Maintains audit trail # Returns deletion count Key Features Smart Schedule Management: Date Range Flexibility: Create schedules for single days or extended periods Working Pattern Templates: Quick setup for common patterns (Mon-Fri, Weekends Off) Bulk Actions: Apply settings to multiple days at once Time Management: Set shift start/end times and break periods User Interface Features: Color-Coded Days: Each day of the week has a unique color Responsive Design: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile Real-time Validation: Immediate feedback on invalid inputs Loading States: Progress indicators for all operations Advanced Functionality: Schedule Versioning: Date range changes create new versions Conflict Resolution: Prevents overlapping schedules Search & Filter: Find schedules quickly Export Capabilities: Generate reports and exports API Endpoints Operation Endpoint Method Purpose Get All Schedules /api/all-schedules GET Management table data Staff Schedules /api/staff/{id}/all-schedules GET Individual staff schedules Schedule Details /api/schedule/{id}/details GET Single schedule information Create Schedule /shift-scheduler/save POST Add new schedules Update Schedule /api/schedule/{id}/update-with-range PUT Modify existing schedule Delete Schedule /api/schedule/{id} DELETE Remove single schedule Bulk Delete /shift-scheduler/delete POST Remove multiple schedules Database Structure StaffScheduleRange Model: - id: Primary key - staff_id: Foreign key to User - schedule_name: Descriptive name - start_date/end_date: Date range - monday-sunday: Boolean working days - shift_start_time/shift_end_time: Time fields - break_time: Text description - description: Additional notes - priority: Integer ranking - is_active: Soft delete flag - created_at/updated_at: Timestamps Workflow Example Creating a Schedule: Admin selects staff member Sets date range (e.g., Sept 15-19, 2025) Generates 5-day table Sets working days (Mon-Fri: Yes, Weekends: No) Configures times (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM) Adds break time (1 hour lunch) Saves schedule Editing a Schedule: Admin finds schedule in management table Clicks "Edit" button Modal opens with pre-filled data Modifies working days or times Saves changes (creates new version if dates changed) Viewing Schedules: Management table shows overview Click staff name for detailed view Individual schedule cards show specific details All actions available from any view This system provides complete CRUD functionality with advanced features for real-world shift scheduling needs, including conflict resolution, audit trails, and flexible working patterns.
