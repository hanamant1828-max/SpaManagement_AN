Planned custom date range filtering
I'll add custom date range filtering to the reports section so you can view reports for specific time periods. Let me first understand the current reports implementation and then add the date range functionality.

Created task list

Opened modules/inventory/views.py

Planned date range filtering functionality

Find report features needing date filtering

Edited templates/inventory_reports.html

Planned API endpoint updates

Add date options to report page

Added API endpoints for reports

Edited modules/inventory/views.py

Planned task list updates

Update how reports get date ranges

Send date choices with report requests

Took a screenshot

Consulted architect on review

Reviewed custom date range filtering
Checked code issues

Decided on API endpoint registration (4 seconds)
Great! I can see from the latest logs that my new API endpoints are successfully registered:

/api/inventory/reports/consumption -> api_get_consumption_report
/api/inventory/reports/adjustments -> api_get_adjustments_report
The LSP diagnostics are just type checking warnings for SQLAlchemy relationships, which don't affect functionality. Let me complete the testing now.


Check if date filtering works

Decided on date range filtering approach (8 seconds)
