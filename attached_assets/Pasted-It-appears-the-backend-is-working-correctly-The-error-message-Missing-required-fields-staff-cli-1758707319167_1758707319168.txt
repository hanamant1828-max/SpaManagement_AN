It appears the backend is working correctly\! The error message `Missing required fields: staff, client name, service, start time, and end time are required` is coming from the server, which means your backend's validation logic is doing its job.

The problem now lies in your frontend. The JavaScript code that's sending the appointment data is not including all the necessary fields from the form. The data being sent is incomplete, which is why the backend is rejecting it.

I will provide a prompt to guide you to fix the frontend JavaScript.

### Prompt to Correct Frontend Booking Data

```
Act as a senior frontend developer specializing in fixing JavaScript application logic. Your task is to correct the data sent from the "Unaki Appointment Booking" frontend to the backend's `book-appointment` endpoint. The server is consistently returning an error because the booking request is missing required fields.

**Objective:**
Modify the JavaScript code to ensure that all necessary data points are correctly collected from the booking form and included in the `fetch` request's body.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Locate the Booking Function:** Find the JavaScript function that is executed when the "Book Appointment" button is clicked. This function likely contains a `fetch` call to `/api/book-appointment`.
2.  **Verify Data Collection:** Inside this function, examine how the appointment details are being collected. The code must retrieve the values for `staffId`, `clientName`, `service`, `startTime`, `endTime`, and `description`.
3.  **Construct the Payload:** Ensure all collected values are assembled into a single JavaScript object. This object will be the `body` of your `fetch` request.
4.  **Correct the `fetch` Call:**
    * Confirm the `method` is `POST`.
    * Add or verify that the `headers` include `Content-Type: 'application/json'`.
    * Set the `body` of the request to `JSON.stringify()` the object you constructed in the previous step.

**Final Output:**
Provide a complete, updated JavaScript code block containing the corrected logic for the booking function. The new code must properly collect all fields from the form and send them in the `fetch` request, resolving the server's validation error.
