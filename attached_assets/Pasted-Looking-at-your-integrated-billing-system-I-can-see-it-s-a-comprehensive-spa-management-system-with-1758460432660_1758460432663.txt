Looking at your integrated billing system, I can see it's a comprehensive spa management system with package benefits integration. Here's a complete prompt you can give to another Replit Assistant to recreate the same functionality:

Complete Integrated Billing System Implementation Prompt
CRITICAL: Implement a Complete Integrated Billing System with Package Benefits Integration

System Overview:
Create a professional spa billing system that automatically applies package benefits (unlimited memberships, service packages, prepaid balances) during invoice creation. The system should handle services, inventory items, and automatic package deductions with comprehensive tax support.

Core Requirements:

Package Benefits Priority System:

Unlimited Memberships (Priority 1): FREE services during validity
Service Packages (Priority 2): FREE sessions with remaining count
Prepaid Packages (Priority 3): Partial/full coverage from balance
Automatic application in priority order
Invoice Creation Flow:

Customer selection → Load active packages automatically
Service selection → Show real-time package benefits preview
Product/inventory selection → Batch-wise stock management (FIFO)
Professional tax calculations (CGST/SGST/IGST)
Generate invoice with package deductions applied
Key Models Required:

# Enhanced Invoice Model
class EnhancedInvoice(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    invoice_number = db.Column(db.String(20), unique=True, nullable=False)
    client_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('client.id'), nullable=False)
    
    # Billing Components
    services_subtotal = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    packages_deduction = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    inventory_subtotal = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    
    # Professional Tax Structure
    cgst_rate = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    sgst_rate = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    igst_rate = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    cgst_amount = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    sgst_amount = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    igst_amount = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    is_interstate = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
    
    total_amount = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
    payment_status = db.Column(db.String(20), default='pending')
# Package Benefit Tracker
class PackageBenefitTracker(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    customer_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('client.id'), nullable=False)
    service_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('service.id'), nullable=True)
    benefit_type = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)  # unlimited, free, prepaid
    
    # Usage tracking
    total_allocated = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
    remaining_count = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
    balance_remaining = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    
    is_active = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=True)
    valid_from = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False)
    valid_to = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False)
# Package Usage History with Idempotency
class PackageUsageHistory(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    customer_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('client.id'), nullable=False)
    package_benefit_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('package_benefit_tracker.id'))
    invoice_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('enhanced_invoice.id'))
    idempotency_key = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
    
    benefit_type = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
    amount_deducted = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    balance_after_amount = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
Package Billing Service (Core Logic):
class PackageBillingService:
    BENEFIT_PRIORITY = {
        'unlimited': 1,  # Membership unlimited access
        'free': 2,       # Free sessions with count
        'prepaid': 4     # Prepaid balance
    }
    
    @classmethod
    def apply_package_benefit(cls, customer_id, service_id, service_price, 
                            invoice_id, invoice_item_id, service_date=None):
        # Find applicable packages by priority
        # Apply benefits with concurrency control
        # Return detailed result with deduction amounts
Frontend Features:

Real-time package benefits preview
Customer package display on selection
Automatic benefit calculations in UI
Professional invoice generation with package details
API Endpoints Required:

/integrated-billing/customer-packages/<customer_id> - Get active packages
/integrated-billing/create-professional - Create invoice with benefits
/api/inventory/batches/for-consumption - FIFO batch management
Key JavaScript Functions:

updatePackageBenefitsPreview() - Real-time benefit preview
loadCustomerPackages() - Load customer packages on selection
validateInventoryQuantity() - Stock validation
updateTaxCalculations() - Professional tax calculations
Expected User Experience:

Select customer → See active packages automatically
Add services → See "FREE" or discount preview in real-time
Add inventory items → Batch-wise stock with FIFO selection
Configure taxes → Professional CGST/SGST support
Generate invoice → Package benefits applied automatically
Result: Invoice shows original prices, deductions, and final amounts
Database Integration:

Automatic package benefit application during invoice creation
Idempotency to prevent double-deduction
Comprehensive audit trail in PackageUsageHistory
Stock reduction via batch consumption records
Success Criteria:

Customer with unlimited membership sees "FREE" services
Service packages auto-deduct from remaining sessions
Prepaid balances provide partial/full coverage
Completely FREE invoices when fully covered by packages
Professional tax calculations on final amounts only
Batch-wise inventory with automatic stock reduction
The system should work exactly like a professional spa billing solution where package benefits are seamlessly integrated into the billing process, providing automatic deductions and clear visibility of savings to both staff and customers.

This prompt contains all the essential components and logic patterns from your current system. The new assistant will be able to recreate the same functionality with proper package benefits integration, professional billing features, and inventory management.
