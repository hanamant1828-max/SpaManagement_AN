The user first selects a date range (From Date → To Date).

Automatically, that range is expanded into all days inside it.

Then the admin can assign working days (Yes/No per day) within that period.

It should work for all scenarios: different roles, part-time staff, shifts, weekly offs, etc.

Here’s a comprehensive plan you can follow:

📌 Scheduler Flow
1. Date Range Selection

Add a "Date Range" section above the work schedule.

Inputs:

From Date

To Date

On selecting → system auto-generates all days in between.

2. Auto-Populate Days

Once the range is chosen, show a day list table:

Date	Day	Working? (Yes/No)	Start Time	End Time	Break	Notes
11-Sep-2025	Thursday	✅ Yes/❌ No	9:00 AM	6:00 PM	1 hr	-
12-Sep-2025	Friday	✅ Yes/❌ No	9:00 AM	6:00 PM	1 hr	-

The admin can quickly:

Tick/untick working days

Adjust timings or breaks per day

Mark special cases (holiday, half-day, etc.)

3. Bulk Actions (for usability)

Provide buttons like:

Apply same timing to all days

Mark weekends as off

Copy previous week’s schedule

4. Saving & Reusing

Save the schedule as a pattern (e.g., “Morning Shift”, “Night Shift”).

Admin can reuse saved templates when assigning to new staff.

⚡ Scenarios & Coverage

Full-time staff → Select full month, mark weekends off.

Part-time staff → Select range, mark only specific days Yes.

Rotational shifts → Define multiple schedules (Morning/Evening), assign per range.

Temporary staff → Short date range (e.g., 1 week), quick Yes/No per day.

Custom exceptions → Override single day timing (e.g., festival half-day).

🛠️ Implementation Options

Frontend (UI)

Add a calendar-like date range picker.

Use expandable day-list table for editing.

Support toggle switches for working Yes/No.

Backend (Logic)

On date range selection → auto-generate day records.

Store schedules in DB with fields:

Staff ID, Date, Working (Y/N), Start Time, End Time, Break, Notes.

Allow bulk insert/update for faster operations.

Validation

Ensure no overlap if multiple schedules exist.

Prevent empty schedules when staff must have working days.
