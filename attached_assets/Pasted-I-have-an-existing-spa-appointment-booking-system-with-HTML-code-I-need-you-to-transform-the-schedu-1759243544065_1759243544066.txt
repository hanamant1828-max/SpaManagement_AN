I have an existing spa appointment booking system with HTML code. I need you to transform the schedule view to match a specific calendar timeline design.

CURRENT CODE: [paste your HTML file content here]

TRANSFORM IT TO THIS STYLE:

MAIN CHANGES NEEDED:

1. TOP NAVIGATION BAR:
   - Fixed header with white background
   - Left: Logo/app name
   - Center: Date navigator with prev/next arrows and current date
   - Right: "New Appointment" button, refresh icon, settings icon

2. LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
   - Remove the current grid system
   - Create a two-panel layout:
     * Left sidebar (200px fixed width): Staff list
     * Right panel (flex): Timeline grid with horizontal scroll

3. STAFF SIDEBAR:
   - Show each staff member as a row (80px height)
   - Display: circular avatar, name, role
   - Align with corresponding grid rows

4. TIMELINE GRID:
   - Header row: Show hours 9 AM to 9 PM (each 80px wide)
   - Grid body: One row per staff member
   - Each hour divided into 12 sub-columns (5-minute intervals)
   - Visual lines:
     * Light gray (#f1f5f9) for 5-min marks
     * Medium gray (#e2e8f0) for 15-min marks
     * Thick gray (#cbd5e0) for 30-min mark
     * Bold line (#e9ecef) for hour boundaries

5. APPOINTMENT BLOCKS:
   - Position absolutely based on start time
   - Width calculated from duration (1 hour = 80px)
   - Keep the color coding by service type
   - Show client name, service, time
   - Left border (4px) in service color
   - Add box shadow and hover effects

6. INTERACTIVE FEATURES:
   - Click any 5-minute slot to open booking modal
   - Right-click appointments for context menu
   - Show current time as a red vertical line
   - Enable horizontal and vertical scrolling

7. STYLING:
   - Clean, minimal design
   - White/light gray color scheme
   - Remove the purple gradient backgrounds
   - Use subtle shadows instead of heavy gradients
   - Modern sans-serif fonts

Keep all the existing functionality (booking, editing, deleting appointments, API calls, etc.) but completely redesign the visual presentation to match this calendar timeline style.
