Create a full End-to-End (E2E) testing suite for the Student Offer module in the Spa Management System.

Test Scope:
- Admin login
- Student Offer page access
- Add Student Offer
- Edit Student Offer
- Assign Student Offer to customer
- Verify assignment in billing
- Expiry validation
- Cleanup

Test Cases:

1. Admin Login
   - Log in as Admin user.
   - Assert dashboard loads successfully.

2. Student Offer Page Access
   - Navigate to Student Offers page.
   - Verify presence of:
       • "Add Student Offer" button
       • Offers table
       • Assign tab
       • Add/Edit modal or new page.

3. Add Student Offer
   - Open Add Student Offer form.
   - Select multiple services from dropdown.
   - Enter valid discount percentage (e.g., 20%).
   - Set Valid From = today, Valid To = +30 days.
   - Enter valid days (Mon–Fri).
   - Enter terms & conditions.
   - Save offer.
   - Assert success message and verify new row in offers table.

4. Edit Student Offer
   - Select the newly created offer.
   - Change discount percentage (e.g., 20% → 25%).
   - Extend validity dates.
   - Save changes.
   - Assert updated values shown in table.

5. Assign Student Offer
   - Create a test customer.
   - Assign the created Student Offer to that customer.
   - Assert assignment appears in “Assigned Offers” tab for that customer.

6. Billing Integration Test
   - Simulate billing for the test customer.
   - Add a service that is covered by the assigned Student Offer.
   - Assert discount is applied correctly on invoice line.
   - Example: Service price ₹500, discount 25% → final price ₹375.

7. Expiry Validation
   - Update Valid To date to yesterday.
   - Bill the same service again.
   - Assert Student Offer discount does NOT apply (full price charged).
   - Assert invoice note shows “Offer expired”.

8. Negative Test Cases
   - Try to save without selecting services → expect validation error.
   - Enter discount percentage > 100 → expect validation error.
   - Valid To < Valid From → expect validation error.

9. Cleanup
   - Delete test Student Offer.
   - Delete test customer.
   - Assert records no longer appear in database or list view.

Expected Result:
- All test cases should pass.
- Add/Edit/Assign flows work correctly.
- Billing applies discounts correctly while offer is valid.
- Expired offers do not apply.
- Validation errors handled gracefully.
