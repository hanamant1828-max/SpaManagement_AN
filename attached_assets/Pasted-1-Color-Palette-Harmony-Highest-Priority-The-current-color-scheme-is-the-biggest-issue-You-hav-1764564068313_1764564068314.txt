1. Color Palette & Harmony (Highest Priority)
The current color scheme is the biggest issue. You have a "Dark Mode" black/gold theme, but you are mixing it with high-saturation primary colors (Blue, Green, Cyan) for the section headers. This clashes and breaks the "luxury" feel.

Remove the Rainbow Headers: Change the background colors of "Your Information" (Blue), "Appointments" (Green), and "Booking Summary" (Cyan) to match the global theme.

Suggestion: Use transparent backgrounds with a Gold (#FFD700) bottom border, or use a very dark grey (#1f1f1f) card background for these sections.

Stick to a 60-30-10 Rule:

60% (Dominant): Black / Dark Grey (Backgrounds).

30% (Secondary): White or Light Grey (Text).

10% (Accent): Gold (Buttons, Borders, Highlights).

Booking Summary Panel: Instead of a Cyan header, make the whole summary panel a distinct dark card (e.g., #111111 or #222222) with a subtle gold border to make it pop against the black background.

2. Typography & Readability
Contrast Issues: The gold text inside the input fields (e.g., "Enter your full name") is a bit hard to read against the black, and it competes with the gold field borders.

Suggestion: Change placeholder text to a medium grey (e.g., #888888). Keep the user's typed input White or Off-White for maximum readability.

Font Weights: The "Spa & Salon" logo font (Serif) is nice, but using it for "Book Multiple Appointments" is good. However, ensure your body text (labels, inputs) is a clean Sans-Serif font (like Inter, Roboto, or Lato) to ensure legibility at small sizes.

3. Layout & Spacing (White Space)
The elements feel a bit tight. Luxury design needs "breathing room."

Padding: Add more padding inside your sections (the boxes). The text is touching the borders in some places.

Grid Alignment: In the "Appointments" section, the "End Time" field looks slightly wider or misaligned compared to the "Date" field above it. Ensure all input boxes align perfectly on a grid.

Sidebar Alignment: In the "Booking Summary" on the right, the values (0 mins, ₹0.00) are pushed to the far right edge. Add some right-padding so they aren't touching the border.

4. Input Field Design
Read-Only State: The "End Time" field is auto-calculated. Visually, it should look different from the editable fields so the user doesn't try to click it.

Suggestion: Make the background of that specific input slightly lighter grey or dim the opacity of the text to indicate it is "disabled/read-only."

Borders: having a bright gold border on every empty input field creates a lot of visual noise.

Suggestion: Make the default border a dark grey (#333). Change the border to Gold only when the user clicks/focuses on that specific field. This guides the eye.

5. Call to Action (Buttons)
"Complete All Fields" Button: This is currently grayed out/disabled. While this is good logic, it looks unappealing.

Suggestion: Once the form is valid, this button should become the brightest element on the page (Solid Gold background with Black text).

"Save & Add Another Appointment": This button is very large (outline style).

Suggestion: Reduce its visual weight. It competes with the final "Complete" button. Maybe make it smaller or use a simpler "Plus (+)" icon style.

Header Button: You have a "Book Now" button in the top navigation while the user is already on the booking page.

Suggestion: Hide the "Book Now" button in the navbar when the user is on the actual Booking page to avoid redundancy.

6. Visual Mockup Example
Here is how I would restructure the CSS variables to instantly upgrade the look:

CSS

:root {
  --bg-color: #000000;
  --card-bg: #121212; /* Slightly lighter than black for sections */
  --text-primary: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: #aaaaaa; /* For placeholders */
  --accent-gold: #D4AF37; /* A more metallic gold, less yellow */
  --border-color: #333333;
}

/* Apply to section headers */
.section-header {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: var(--accent-gold);
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--accent-gold);
  /* Remove the Blue/Green/Cyan backgrounds */
}

/* Apply to Input fields */
input, select {
  background: transparent;
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color); /* Grey by default */
  color: var(--text-primary);
}

input:focus, select:focus {
  border-color: var(--accent-gold); /* Gold only on focus */
  outline: none;
}
Summary of Next Steps
Neutralize the section header colors (remove the blue/green/cyan).

Change input borders to grey, highlighting gold only on focus.

Increase padding inside the summary box and form sections.

Fix text contrast (Make user input white, placeholders grey).
