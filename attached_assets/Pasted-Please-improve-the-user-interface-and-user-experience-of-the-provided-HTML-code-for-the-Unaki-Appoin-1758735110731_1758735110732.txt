Please improve the user interface and user experience of the provided HTML code for the Unaki Appointment Booking application.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** Do not alter the core JavaScript logic or any of the data handling functions (e.g., `loadScheduleData`, `bookAppointment`, `seedSampleData`). Your changes should be limited to the presentation layer.

**UI/UX Improvement Objectives:**

1.  **Visual Polish:**
    * Give the entire application a more modern and professional feel with a refined color palette, font styles, and spacing.
    * Enhance the visual design of all components, including the header, buttons, input fields, and the booking modal, using Tailwind CSS classes.
    * Apply subtle visual effects like shadows and transitions to create a more dynamic and interactive user interface.

2.  **Layout and Readability:**
    * Optimize the schedule grid to be more readable and intuitive. Add clear visual markers to represent half-hour time slots.
    * Ensure the layout is fully responsive and looks great on both mobile and desktop screens.

3.  **User Experience (UX):**
    * Add clear visual cues to guide the user, such as icons or loading indicators.
    * Make interactive elements, like buttons and the draggable schedule, feel more responsive and intuitive to use.

The final output should be a single, complete, and runnable `index.html` file that fulfills these requirements without changing any of the application's existing logic.
