Remove the Work Schedule block from the Add New Staff Member modal and make sure the form, validations, and backend no longer expect those fields.

Files to update

Frontend (adjust for my stack):

If plain HTML/JS: staff-modal.html, staff-modal.css, staff-modal.js

If component-based: StaffModal.* (React/Vue/Svelte) and its styles

Backend (only if we currently send/expect schedule fields):

Controller/route handling Staff create/update

DTO/model/schema where shiftStart, shiftEnd, workingDays may exist

What to remove (UI)

Entire card/fieldset titled “Work Schedule” containing:

Shift Start (time)

Shift End (time)

Working Days (any input, text box, or helper)

Remove any helper text referencing scheduling inside this modal.

What to add (UI)

In place of that block, show a tiny muted note under the form:

“Scheduling is managed separately. Use Staff Scheduling after saving the staff profile.”

Reflow the layout so the right column (where Work Schedule was) doesn’t leave empty space:

Expand adjacent sections to full width on desktop.

Keep spacing and headings consistent.

Keep all remaining sections unchanged:

Basic Information

Role & Department

Personal Details

Advanced Features

Additional Information

Form & validation updates

Remove any required or optional validations for:

shiftStart, shiftEnd, workingDays

Ensure the Submit/Save button state no longer depends on those fields.

On submit, the payload must not include those keys.

Backend/API updates

If staff create/update endpoints currently accept these fields:

Mark them deprecated and ignore, or

Remove them from DTOs entirely.

Database:

If columns exist (shift_start, shift_end, working_days), do not drop today. Make them nullable and stop writing to them. (Optional migration later.)

Make sure staff creation works without these fields and returns the same success response.

Cleanup

Delete any dead code (getters, watchers, parsers) tied to the removed fields.

Remove tooltip text or examples like “1111100 = Monday to Friday” if still present.

No console warnings/errors after save.

QA (manual checks)

Open Add New Staff Member → confirm Work Schedule block is gone, layout looks balanced.

Fill required fields (username, first/last name, email, etc.) → Save succeeds.

Inspect network request → payload has no shiftStart, shiftEnd, or workingDays.

Create and edit a staff again → still no schedule fields sent; no errors.

Confirm the small note about using Staff Scheduling is visible.

If a Staff Scheduling page exists, its entry point still works independently.

Acceptance criteria

No Work Schedule UI in the modal.

No validation expecting schedule fields.

No schedule fields sent to the server.

Save/edit flows succeed with zero console errors.

Layout remains professional on desktop and mobile.

If file names/paths differ, adapt, but keep the removal and reflow exactly as specified.
