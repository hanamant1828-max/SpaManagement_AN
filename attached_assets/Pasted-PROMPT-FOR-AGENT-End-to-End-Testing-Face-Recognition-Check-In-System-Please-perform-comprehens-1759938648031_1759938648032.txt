PROMPT FOR AGENT: End-to-End Testing - Face Recognition Check-In System

Please perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of the Face Recognition Check-In system and identify all issues. Here's what needs to be tested:

Testing Scope
1. Check-In Page Functionality (/checkin route)
Verify the page loads without errors
Check if all DOM elements are present (video, buttons, placeholder)
Test "Start Recognition" button click event
Verify camera access and permissions handling
Test video stream initialization
Check if video plays correctly in the browser
2. Face Recognition Flow
Test camera start → capture → recognition → stop flow
Verify frame capture from video stream
Test API call to /api/recognize_face endpoint
Check if customer data is correctly recognized
Verify customer info display in the UI
Test appointment highlighting after recognition
3. Backend API Testing
Test /api/recognize_face endpoint with sample face images
Verify customer matching logic
Check database queries for customers with face data
Test face encoding comparison
Verify JSON response structure and data accuracy
4. Integration Testing
Test data flow from camera → API → database → UI
Verify customer-appointment association
Check if recognized customer's appointments are highlighted correctly
Test the "Check In" button functionality after recognition
5. Error Handling
Test camera permission denial
Test with no registered faces in database
Test with unrecognized faces
Test network failures during API calls
Test missing customer data scenarios
6. UI/UX Testing
Verify button state changes (enabled/disabled)
Check loading indicators and status messages
Test camera overlay and scanning animation
Verify modal displays and transitions
Test responsive behavior
Expected Deliverables
Please provide:

Test Results Summary - Pass/Fail for each test case

Bug Report - List all issues found with:

Issue description
Steps to reproduce
Expected vs actual behavior
Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
Suggested fix
Console Log Analysis - Review browser console and server logs for:

JavaScript errors
Failed API calls
Warning messages
Performance issues
Code Review - Identify:

Missing event listeners
Incorrect element selectors
Logic errors in recognition flow
Potential race conditions
Current Known Issues to Investigate
Based on the console logs, specifically investigate:

Why "Start Recognition" button click is not triggering the event handler
Verify onclick vs addEventListener implementation
Check if buttons have type="button" attribute
Compare working customer management face recognition with check-in implementation
Testing Environment
Use the existing test customers in the database
Ensure at least one customer has face data registered
Test in Chrome/Firefox browsers
Check both desktop and mobile views
Please run this comprehensive test suite and provide a detailed report with findings and recommended fixes.
