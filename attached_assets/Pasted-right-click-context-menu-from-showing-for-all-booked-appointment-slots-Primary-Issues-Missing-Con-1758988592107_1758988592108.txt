right-click context menu from showing for all booked appointment slots:
Primary Issues:

Missing Context Menu Script Reference - The HTML references appointment_context_menu.js but this script file is not included in your document, so the context menu functionality is not defined.
Incomplete Context Menu Implementation - The handleAppointmentRightClick function is referenced in event listeners but not actually implemented in the code.
Missing Context Menu Initialization - The code references window.reinitializeContextMenu() but this function is not defined anywhere.
Event Handler Registration Issues - Right-click event listeners are only added during appointment block creation, but may not persist through DOM updates or schedule refreshes.
Event Propagation Problems - The context menu events may be getting blocked by parent element click handlers or other event listeners.

Secondary Issues:

Inconsistent Appointment ID Handling - Some appointment blocks may not have proper data-appointment-id attributes set, which would prevent context menu functionality.
DOM Element Selection Issues - The context menu code tries to reinitialize after DOM changes but the timing and element selection may be unreliable.
Event Listener Cleanup - Old event listeners may not be properly removed when the schedule refreshes, causing conflicts.
CSS Z-index Conflicts - Context menu elements may be appearing behind other elements due to stacking order issues.
Appointment Block Overlap - Overlapping appointments may interfere with right-click detection on the correct appointment block.

Critical Missing Components:

Context Menu HTML Structure - No context menu DOM elements are defined in the HTML.
Context Menu Styling - Missing CSS for context menu appearance and positioning.
Context Menu Action Handlers - Functions like edit, delete, view details are referenced but not fully integrated with the context menu system.

The main problem is that while the appointment blocks have right-click event listeners attached, the actual context menu implementation is missing from your codebase.<!DOCTYPE html>

Here's a comprehensive list:
Critical Functional Issues

Missing Context Menu Implementation

handleAppointmentRightClick function is referenced but not defined
External script appointment_context_menu.js is referenced but not included
Context menu HTML structure is completely missing
No CSS styling for context menu elements


Broken Right-Click Functionality

Right-click event listeners added but handler function doesn't exist
window.reinitializeContextMenu() called but function is undefined
No context menu DOM elements to show/hide
Event propagation issues preventing right-click detection


Incomplete CRUD Operations

Edit appointment functionality partially implemented but not fully connected
Delete appointment function exists but may not be properly integrated with context menu
View appointment details function is just a placeholder



JavaScript Architecture Problems

Function Definition Issues

Functions called before they're defined
Missing function declarations for context menu operations
Inconsistent global function exposure


Event Handler Management

Event listeners not properly cleaned up during DOM updates
Duplicate event listeners potentially being attached
Context menu event handlers not properly bound to appointment blocks


DOM Manipulation Issues

Schedule refresh doesn't properly reinitialize all event listeners
Appointment blocks may lose event handlers after re-rendering
Z-index conflicts between overlays and appointment blocks



Data Management Problems

Appointment ID Handling

Inconsistent appointment ID attribute setting
Some appointment blocks may not have proper data-appointment-id attributes
ID validation missing in context menu operations


Schedule Data Synchronization

Schedule data may become stale after operations
No proper data refresh mechanism after edit/delete operations
Potential race conditions between data updates and UI refresh



UI/UX Issues

Context Menu Positioning

No positioning logic for context menu placement
No boundary detection to prevent menu from appearing off-screen
No consideration for viewport constraints


Visual Feedback Problems

No visual indicators for right-clickable elements
Missing hover states for interactive appointment blocks
No loading states for context menu operations


Accessibility Concerns

No keyboard navigation support for context menu
Missing ARIA labels and roles
No screen reader support for context menu actions



Error Handling Deficiencies

Missing Error Boundaries

No error handling for context menu operations
Missing try-catch blocks around appointment manipulation
No fallback UI for failed operations


API Error Management

Inconsistent error handling for edit/delete operations
No proper user feedback for failed network requests
Missing validation for server responses



Performance Issues

Memory Leaks

Event listeners not properly removed
DOM elements not cleaned up after context menu operations
Potential closure memory retention


Inefficient DOM Operations

Multiple DOM queries for the same elements
Unnecessary re-rendering of entire schedule grid
No debouncing for rapid user interactions



Code Quality Problems

Inconsistent Code Patterns

Mixed approaches to event handling
Inconsistent naming conventions
Duplicate code blocks


Missing Documentation

No comments explaining context menu logic
Missing function parameter documentation
No usage examples for complex functions



Browser Compatibility Issues

Modern JavaScript Features

Potential issues with older browsers
Missing polyfills for certain methods
No graceful degradation for unsupported features



Security Concerns

Input Validation

No sanitization of appointment data before display
Potential XSS vulnerabilities in dynamic content
Missing CSRF protection for API calls



Mobile Responsiveness Problems

Touch Interface Issues

Right-click functionality not adapted for touch devices
No long-press support for mobile context menu
Poor touch target sizing for small appointment blocks



Integration Problems

Modal Conflicts

Potential Z-index conflicts between context menu and modals
Bootstrap modal events may interfere with context menu
Overlay stacking issues


External Dependencies

Missing or broken external script references
Version compatibility issues with Bootstrap/Font Awesome
CDN reliability concerns



The most critical issues to address first are the missing context menu implementation (#1-3) and the broken right-click functionality (#2), as these are preventing the core feature from working at all. Following that, the JavaScript architecture problems (#4-6) need to be resolved to ensure stable functionality.
