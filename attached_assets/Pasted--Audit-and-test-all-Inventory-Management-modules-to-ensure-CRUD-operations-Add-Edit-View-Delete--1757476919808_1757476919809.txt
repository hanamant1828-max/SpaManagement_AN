“Audit and test all Inventory Management modules to ensure CRUD operations (Add, Edit, View, Delete) are implemented correctly using the database only. Remove any dependency on JSON or localStorage. Every module must fetch, create, update, and delete records exclusively through database APIs.”

Modules to Check

Categories

Verify GET /api/categories, POST /api/categories, PUT /api/categories/:id, DELETE /api/categories/:id.

UI: Add/Edit/Delete works via modals.

Validation: Cannot delete if products reference the category.

Category dropdown in Product Master must fetch live DB data.

Locations

Verify GET /api/locations, POST /api/locations, PUT /api/locations/:id, DELETE /api/locations/:id.

UI: Add/Edit/Delete/View works.

Validation: Cannot delete if products or transfers reference the location.

Location dropdown in Product Master must fetch live DB data.

Products (Product Master)

Verify GET /api/products, POST /api/products, PUT /api/products/:id, DELETE /api/products/:id.

Add/Edit modal must populate Category + Location from DB.

Validation: SKU must be unique.

Table and KPIs update live after changes.

Adjustments (Add Inventory Items)

Verify GET /api/adjustments, POST /api/adjustments, PUT /api/adjustments/:id, DELETE /api/adjustments/:id.

Adding adjustments increases stock in DB.

Editing adjusts stock delta correctly.

Deleting rolls back stock correctly.

Movements are logged in DB.

Consumption

Verify GET /api/consumptions, POST /api/consumptions, PUT /api/consumptions/:id, DELETE /api/consumptions/:id.

Adding consumption decreases stock.

Editing reconciles delta.

Deleting restores stock.

Movements logged in DB.

Transfers

Verify GET /api/transfers, POST /api/transfers, PUT /api/transfers/:id, DELETE /api/transfers/:id.

Completing transfer moves stock between locations.

Validation: Cannot transfer more than available.

Movements logged: Transfer Out + Transfer In.

Movements (Audit Log)

Verify GET /api/movements.

All adjustments, consumptions, and transfers must create audit entries in DB.

Audit table must display latest records with filtering and export.

Acceptance Criteria

No JSON or localStorage references left in any module.

All CRUD operations work using database APIs.

Dropdowns (Category, Location, Product selectors) fetch live data from DB.

Validation prevents inconsistent data (e.g., deleting in-use records).

Dashboard KPIs, stock levels, and reports always reflect DB state.

No console errors.

⚡ After this, your entire inventory system will be 100% database-driven and CRUD-verified across all modules.

👉 Do you want me to also write a step-by-step QA checklist (like manual test cases) that you or your team can use to test each CRUD flow in every module?

Perfect ✅ Let’s create a QA Checklist that you (or anyone testing) can follow step by step to validate all CRUD flows across every inventory module — using only the database.

Here’s the structured checklist:

🔍 Inventory Management QA Checklist (Database-Only CRUD)
1. Categories

Goal: Ensure Categories CRUD works via DB only.

 Open Categories tab → verify list is loaded from DB.

 Add Category (valid data) → new row appears, DB updated.

 Add Category (empty name) → validation blocks save.

 Edit Category → update name/status → DB reflects changes.

 Delete Category not in use → row removed, DB updated.

 Delete Category with products linked → blocked with error message.

 Confirm Product Master Category dropdown shows DB data only.

2. Locations

Goal: Ensure Locations CRUD works via DB only.

 Open Locations tab → verify list is loaded from DB.

 Add Location → appears in table, DB updated.

 Edit Location → update type/status → DB reflects changes.

 Delete Location not in use → removed from DB.

 Delete Location with products/transfers linked → blocked with error.

 Confirm Product Master Location dropdown shows DB data only.

3. Products (Product Master)

Goal: Ensure Products CRUD works with DB categories/locations.

 Open Product Master → verify product list loads from DB.

 Add Product (valid data, select category & location from DB) → appears in table + DB.

 Add Product (duplicate SKU) → validation blocks save.

 Edit Product → update stock, reorder level, or status → DB reflects changes.

 Delete Product → removed from DB if not referenced elsewhere.

 Table refreshes automatically after DB update.

4. Adjustments (Add Inventory Items)

Goal: Ensure stock increases via DB.

 Open Adjustments tab → verify list loads from DB.

 Add Adjustment (product + qty) → stock increases in DB.

 Edit Adjustment → adjust qty → stock delta reconciled in DB.

 Delete Adjustment → stock rolled back correctly.

 Movements logged in DB (type = Adjustment).

5. Consumption

Goal: Ensure stock decreases via DB.

 Open Consumption tab → verify list loads from DB.

 Add Consumption (product + qty ≤ stock) → stock decreases in DB.

 Add Consumption (qty > stock) → validation blocks save.

 Edit Consumption → update qty → stock delta reconciled in DB.

 Delete Consumption → stock restored correctly.

 Movements logged in DB (type = Consumption).

6. Transfers

Goal: Ensure stock moves between locations.

 Open Transfers tab → verify list loads from DB.

 Add Transfer (from Location A → Location B, qty ≤ stock) → stock reduced at A, increased at B.

 Add Transfer (qty > stock) → validation blocks save.

 Edit Transfer → update qty → DB reconciles correctly.

 Delete Transfer → roll back stock movement.

 Movements logged in DB (type = Transfer Out and Transfer In).

7. Movements (Audit Log)

Goal: Ensure every stock change is tracked.

 Open Movements tab → list loads from DB.

 Create Adjustment → verify log entry.

 Create Consumption → verify log entry.

 Create Transfer → verify two log entries (Out & In).

 Delete any record → verify rollback logged properly.

8. Dashboard & Reports

Goal: Ensure UI reflects DB state.

 Dashboard KPIs (Total Products, Low Stock, Out of Stock, Inventory Value) match DB values.

 Reports (Inventory Status, Expiry, Transfers, etc.) query DB, not cache.

 Export to Excel uses DB data.

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Every CRUD action across Categories, Locations, Products, Adjustments, Consumption, Transfers is DB-backed.

No JSON / no localStorage anywhere.

Validation prevents inconsistent data.

All dropdowns (Category, Location, Product) always fetch from DB.

Dashboard and reports reflect DB changes in real time.

No console errors during any CRUD action.
