- Password: `admin123`

## Development
The application runs in debug mode for development with hot reload enabled. The workflow is configured to automatically restart when code changes are detected.

## Deployment
Configured for Replit autoscale deployment using Gunicorn WSGI server:
```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port main:app
```

## Recent Changes
