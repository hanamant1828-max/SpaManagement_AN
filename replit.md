## Recent Changes
**September 10, 2025** - Project successfully imported and configured for Replit environment:
- Installed all Python dependencies via packager tool
- Created PostgreSQL database and configured DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Set up SESSION_SECRET environment variable for secure session management
- Configured Flask application for webview compatibility with proper CORS headers
- Set up workflow to run on port 5000 with webview output type
- Configured deployment settings for autoscale with Gunicorn
- Verified application runs successfully with login page accessible
- All modules loading correctly and default data initialization working

**September 10, 2025** - MAJOR INVENTORY SYSTEM REFACTORING - BATCH-CENTRIC APPROACH:
- âœ… Refactored InventoryProduct model - removed all stock tracking fields (current_stock, reserved_stock, available_stock)
- âœ… Updated InventoryBatch model - made batch_name globally unique, added proper relationships
- âœ… Created new InventoryAuditLog model for comprehensive batch transaction tracking
- âœ… Completely rewrote queries.py with clean batch-centric functions (reduced LSP errors from 42 to 26)
- âœ… Updated API endpoints in views.py to use batch-centric approach
- âœ… Implemented batch-first workflow for adjustments, consumption, and stock management
- âœ… Added validation for expired batches and insufficient stock at batch level
- âœ… Created audit log system for tracking all batch-level stock changes
- ðŸ”„ Frontend UI updates needed to implement batch-first workflow with proper dropdowns
- ðŸ”„ Need to fix remaining dashboard references to old stock fields
- ðŸ”„ Transfer APIs need to be implemented for batch-to-batch transfers

## Project Status
ðŸ”„ **REFACTORING IN PROGRESS** - The spa management system's inventory module has been successfully refactored to use a batch-centric approach. The backend models, queries, and API endpoints are updated and working. The application runs successfully with the new architecture. Remaining work includes updating the frontend UI and fixing dashboard references to complete the transition.
